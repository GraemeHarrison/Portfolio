<p>
Born and raised in the capital of Canada, I now reside in Toronto. I’m an artist, a musician, and have an all-around passion for learning. I initially set up this website to sell my own digitally illustrated art prints, and you can still check out the first designs I made by clicking on the “Art Shop” button.
I no longer print and ship my artwork myself, but instead have moved that process to the print-fullfillment/art-community website Crated. I mostly keep this website around for its lookbook, my freelance portfolio, and to let it be a reminder of the hard work and grind-mode mentality I used to create my first business.

I'm happy to hear from anyone that wants to reach out and say what's up, so feel free to drop me a message on LinkedIn here.
