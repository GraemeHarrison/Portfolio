<p><strong>Hi, I’m Graeme.</strong><p/>
<p>
I originally created this website to sell digital art prints, but now it’s mostly reminiscent of the couple of years that I worked on graphic design projects. I currently work full time as an iOS software developer and I plan on updating my portfolio with more relevant app-related work. 
</p>
<p>
Stay tuned!
