Hi, I’m Graeme. I currently work full time as an iOS software developer.
<p/>
<p>
I originally created this website to sell digital art prints, and now it’s mostly reminiscent of the couple of years that I worked with clients on graphic design projects. I plan on updating my protfolio with more relevant, app-related work so stay tuned!
