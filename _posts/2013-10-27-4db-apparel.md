<p><strong>Clothing for Da Boys</strong></p>
<p><em>4DB</em> stands for “for da boys”. This clothing startup was the brainchild of two friends of mine who wanted to build a brand that celebrated togetherness, as is beautifully summed up in our mission statement:</p>
<p>"4DB Apparel is quality clothing made by da boyz—4 da boyz. 4DB is about camaraderie, the notion that the whole is greater than the sum of its parts. Living this way comes naturally to us as we've learned first hand that anything can be made more enjoyable if you have people to enjoy it with. Life is just better with your boys, and we want you to see that."</p>
<p>I was invited to help bring my boys’ vision into fruition by leading its creative side through original clothing design, photography, and making sure it all came together on <em>4db.co</em>.</p>
