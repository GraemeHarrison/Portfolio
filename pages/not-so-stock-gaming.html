In early 2014, <em>NSSG</em> became my first clients ever when they reached out to me to create their logo.</p>
<p>Originally, <em>NSSG</em> wanted realistic looking Spartan shields to to reflect the battle scenes that are common in the games they play. After seeing the draft below, however, they decided that shields had become too cliché and instead settled on a colourful viking ship with a fist on the sail.</p>
