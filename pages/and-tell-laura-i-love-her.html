<p><strong>And Tell Laura I Love Her</strong></p>
<p>"And Tell Laura I Love Her" was a 1950's-themed event put on by <span style="color: #0000ff;"><a href="http://www.ottawastorytellers.ca" target="_blank" title="http://www.ottawastorytellers.ca" style="color: #0000ff;" rel="noopener noreferrer"><em>Ottawa StoryTellers</em></a></span><em>,</em> from which the entry cover proceeds were donated to the <span style="color: #0000ff;"><a href="http://www.stephenlewisfoundation.org/get-involved/grandmothers-campaign" target="_blank" title="http://www.stephenlewisfoundation.org/get-involved/grandmothers-campaign" style="color: #0000ff;" rel="noopener noreferrer"><em>Stephen Lewis Foundation Grandmothers Campaign</em></a></span>.</p>
<p>The design on the left was my first draft, which was eventually changed to the one on the right to better match the event's pre-existing promotional material.</p>
