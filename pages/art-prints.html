<p><strong>Art Prints</strong></p>
<p>I originally created <span style="color: #0000ff;"><a href="https://graemeharrison.com" target="_blank" title="https://graemeharrison.com" style="color: #0000ff;" rel="noopener noreferrer"><em>GraemeHarrison.com</em></a></span> to sell my own pattern-based art prints. It was my first taste of entrepreneurship, and the first time I really put my art skills to work. Even though I no longer us this website to sell prints, I have taken what it's taught me about business and marketing and put it to good use in other entrepreneurial and design-oriented projects.  </p>
