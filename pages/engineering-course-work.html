<p>Once upon a time I took engineering at the University of Guelph for a couple of years before finding a new major. One interesting design-relevant project I worked on in that time was being tasked with dismantling an electric bread maker and reconstructing
  it in Unigraphics NX5. In a group with 9 other students, we took apart the device piece by piece and equally distributed them amongst us to measure and then render in the 3D CAD software. The final step was uploading everyone's rendered parts onto the
  same computer and rebuilding the bread maker with them, making sure the dimensions and calculated volume/weight was accurate.</p>
