<p><strong>Building The Network</strong></p>
<p><span style="color: #0000ff;"><a href="https://www.citizenadvocacy.org/lifetime-networks/" target="_blank" title="https://www.citizenadvocacy.org/lifetime-networks/" style="color: #0000ff;" rel="noopener noreferrer"><em>Lifetime Networks</em></a></span> is an organization that helps people with disabilities build a circle of supportive friends that extends beyond their immediate families. In 2010, <em>Life Networks</em> merged with the charitable organization <em>Citizen Advocacy of Ottawa</em>, for whom I previously designed various forms of paper media and logos. <em>Life Networks</em> asked me to create an infographic for them called "Building The Network", to explain their process of helping new members develop a supportive circle of friends.</p>
